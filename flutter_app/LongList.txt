LongList:
In order to create a long list, we need to do the below things:
1. Prepare the data source:
    This is needed to inflate in each of the list item in the list view.

2. Convert the data source into widgets:
    Because in the end  the listview expects an array of widgets.

3. Use widgets as a children of a ListView:
    Finally, we have to use all the widgets as a children of the listview.
