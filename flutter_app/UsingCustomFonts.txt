In order to use custom fonts in our Flutter application, we need to do the below things:
1. Download and import the font file.
2. Declare it in pubspec.yaml file.
3. Finally, use it in our text widget or anywhere in the application.

1. Download the font:
- To download open source fonts, go to fonts.google.com
- Search for the font you want, select and download it.
- The zip file contains all of the fonts in that font family.
- Select all or what you want and copy them.
- Create a directory named 'fonts' in the root directory and paste the fonts there.

2. Declare it in pubspec.yaml:
- It is the file containing the dependencies and metadata. Similar to build.gradle file in Android
- .yaml - Ain't MarkUp Language. It is used to store configurations, dependencies and metadata in many frameworks.
- pubspec.yaml - Containing most of the configurations of our application. The name, description, flutter SDK
- Go to the font sections and declare your fonts.
- While defining the fonts, use a proper indentation of 2 spaces.

3. Use it in widget:
- Define the font family.
- The name given in the font family should actually match the name defined in pubspec.yaml.
- You can specify fontWeight with FontWeight.{value} which actuall call the font with the weight in the pubspec.yaml file.

Whenever you made changes in the pubspec.yaml file, rung get dependencies.
